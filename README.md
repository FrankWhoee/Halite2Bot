# Halite2-Bot
My bot for Halite II, a coding competition.

All of the bots have been unzipped! :D
Thanks to Zer0 for unzipping them.

I'd like to thank the halite developers and all the players especially the people in the discord for supporting me! I've met truly incredible people on this journey. This happens to be my first coding competition and I will be back for Halite III, if there will be one :D.
