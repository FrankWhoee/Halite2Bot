# Halite2-Bot
My bot for Halite II, a coding competition.

If you want to see the one that is currently competing in the finals, Check out the folder GuardionONE, and within Guardian-v2 should be the folder that you want.

I have unzipped some of the best bots from each "type" to make it easier to browse. It's a huge mess and next time I'm labelling with actual version numbers.

//TODO: FINISH UNZIPPING BEST BOTS FROM EACH TYPE

^^(did I do that right?)^^

I'd like to thank the halite developers and all the players especially the people in the discord for supporting me! I've met truly incredible people on this journey. This happens to be my first coding competition and I will be back for Halite III, if there will be one :D.
